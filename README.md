What do I implemented?
I merged two datasets in the Recommendation area, one of which was about Given Data about the mental health of employees in the Tech Industry. The second dataset is about BMI and Nutritional Details based on height, weight, age, and gender. Both datasets are integrated, and recommended diet and activity are common for both content-based and cross-domain use (these are the recommendation systems)
